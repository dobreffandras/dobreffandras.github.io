Hi, I'm Andr√°s! 

I'm an enthusiastic software developer who likes to take care into his work.
My passion for programming started in my middleschool years. I was fascinated by visual effects (VFX) and wanted to create a website for my own works. So my story began with the google search "how to create a website"....

I have been pursuing my hobby as a job since 2015. I had the opportunity to work with different technologies during my career but the tech-stack I know the best is .NET. Apart from it I'm keeping my knowledge of webtechnologies fresh, and doing some Python work from time to time. For example contributing to my [father's book about Python programming](https://pythontudasepites.hu/) as a reviewer.

I'm motivated by the art of programming. I take pleasure in building software constructs that look good and work good. And if the citation "Clean Code that works" is familiar, you know what I'm talking about (it's the goal of TDD by the way). I'm striving to learn this craftsmanship from the greatests: _Clean Code_ from [Uncle Bob](http://cleancoder.com/products), _Refactoring_ from [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_ from [Michael Feathers](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/) and _Test-Driven Development_ from [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/).
